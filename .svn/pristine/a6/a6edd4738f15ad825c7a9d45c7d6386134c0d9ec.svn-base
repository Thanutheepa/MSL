                        <p>
                            Mother Sri Lanka is the story of how the people of one resilient island nation in the Indian Ocean did not allow thirty long years
                            of terrorism drown their hopes and dreams for their motherland. It is the story of a small group of patriotic citizens who wanted
                            to tell their family of twenty million to hold their heads high in pride, believing in themselves. The story of how a country can
                            overcome bloodshed and rise from the ashes of war, learning from the mistakes of the past, uniting under one flag, as one nation,
                            as one people who believe in their country.
                        </p>

                            The Mother Sri Lanka (MSL) movement was started in 2008 by the Mother Sri Lanka Trust which is a non-profit, independent charity using a unique operational model of private funding, public sector infrastructure and managed by a team of professionals from all sectors.  The movement is managed by a group of patriotic, dedicated passionate individuals from the public, private and non-profit sectors.  In 2016, the Board and the Management of the Mother Sri Lanka movement expanded its’ scope and established the Mother Lanka Foundation which is set up as a non-profit organisation responsible for the movements programs and activities.
