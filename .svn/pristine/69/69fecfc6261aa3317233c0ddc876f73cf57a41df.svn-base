                        <p>
                            We carry out programs targeting pre-school children, school children and the youth. We also conduct community programs for the most vulnerable segments in society such as impoverished women, aiming at their empowerment. We also raise awareness among the most influential segments of society aiming at their knowledge enhancement.   The projects are implemented by paid and voluntary members of the movement based in Colombo and in other districts.
                        </p>

In addition, the movement has over 1000 pre-school and school teachers who are currently actively involved in implementing child development and child protection work in all 25 districts of the country.

                        <p>
                            Project RUN is named after the acronyms of the three components, Responsible citizenship, Unity, and National pride.

                        <p>
                            It is a unique concept where children are encouraged to come up with their own project, find the team, and appoint leaders as well as find the finances for the project under the guidance of Mother Sri Lanka
