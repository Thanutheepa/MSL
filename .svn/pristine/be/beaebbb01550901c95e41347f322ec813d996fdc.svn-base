                            MSL was one of the first movements to start reconciliation work in the North and East soon after the end of the
                            30-year long war in May 18, 2009.  We braved the journey to war-torn areas in order to implement the schools
                            program in the East in August 2009 and in the North in December 2009.  The response was overwhelming. 2600
                            schools consisting of public, private and international schools representing all 9 provinces participated under
                            the theme “Apen Ratata, Rata Nagumata” (Our contribution to Nation Building).

                            Project Run, an acronym of three powerful components, Responsible Citizenship, Unity and National Pride is a
                            unique concept where children were motivated and encouraged to design projects that helped uplift lives and
                            enrich communities across the island.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The holistic objective of this project is developing a ‘Responsible Citizen’ while instilling positive
                            thinking and the values of ethnic harmony, leadership and teamwork.  The project also focuses on enhancing
                            entrepreneurship, leadership qualities and project management skills of the youth which will eventually
                            develop students who are strategic thinkers, analysts, motivators and group achievers who can contribute
                            towards Nation building at a young age. Launched in late 2012, with the blessings of the Ministry of
                            Education, MSL Project RUN has become the practical aspect of the Citizen Education subject which will
                            eventually help build responsible citizens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project has had an excellent progress with 1400 projects being implemented so far since the introduction
                            of this program in 2013.
