                        <h3 style="text-align:left">MOTHER SRI LANKA LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our Livelihood Development Project was launched in 2016 with the main aim of protecting
                            livelihoods of micro entrepreneurs who are engaged in the production of authentic Sri Lankan
                            products which are being pushed out of the shelves due to severe competition from imported
                            products. The final outcome of the project is to alleviate poverty of vulnerable segments of
                            society, women’s empowerment and ensuring the continuity of the production of authentic Sri
                            Lankan products for our future generations. The project is a non-profit self-financed project
                            which has to cover all its expenses of administration, man power and marketing through the
                            income earned from sales.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though, most livelihood development programs do well in training the entrepreneur in
                            production, one of the common weaknesses identified in most such programs is the lack of
                            support in accessing the value chain and the lack of knowledge of the entrepreneur to understand
                            market trends, packaging and marketing and the lack of infrastructure to access local and
                            international markets. Mother Sri Lanka’s livelihood development project is designed to give
                            access to markets guidance in design, packaging and marketing of their products to earn fair
                            market prices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mother Sri Lanka also believes that economic empowerment of women is one of the most
                            successful approaches to gender equality. Hence, most of the micro entrepreneurs supported by
                            us are female, while there is also a high number of very talented males who are making a
                            significant contribution to the project. Currently, approximately 1,000 families directly and over
                            5,000 families indirectly benefit from this MSL initiative.
