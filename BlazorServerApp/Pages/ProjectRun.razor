                            The step taken by the Naminioya Secondary school to implement and conduct their project in a way that generates the attitudes of responsible citizenship should be appreciated.
                            <br /><br />
                            The objective of the procect is to clean and maintain the conditions of the polluted urban sections of the Minipe Yoda ela (Canal) which floats through the Hettipola town in Wilgamuwa.
                            <br /><br />
                            The Minipe Yoda Ela which is an essential resource for the lives of the people of Hettipole and  those who are around ,is the only water resource that fulfills the water requirements of not only the residents who live agricultural life styles but also of the outsiders who come to the village.
                            <br /><br />
                            The pollution of this useful canal system owing to various activities of man is a serious issue.
                            <br /><br />
                            The Naminioya Secondary School which has acquired satisfaction by achieving their aims owing to commitment related to cooperation, solidarity, organization and contribution has taken many effective steps towards the future.
                            <br /><br />
                            The contribution of the teachers, students, parents, and external governmental and non governmental institutions and specially the transparency they maintained with relevance to the utilization of financial and physical resources are of great significance as far as a national project of this kind is concerned.
                            <br /><br />
                            The residents of Wilgamuwa and the adjoining areas, the foreigners who visit the area and even all the animals of Wilgamuwa and Wasgamuwa conservations who drink water from this canal can be identified as the direct beneficiaries of this project which carries a lesson relevant to the conservation of natural resourses and inheriting them for the sake of the future generation.
                            <br /><br />
                            Today, the Wilgamuwa Naminioya Secondary School, which is satisfied with a glance of compassion towards fauna and flora and the waterways with the success of the first stage of the programme implemented for purification of the urban parts of Minipe Yoda Ela, and which has in addition to that taken steps to integrate it as a long term programme, is hohoured with Mother Sri Lanka Golden award.

                            Positive ideas lead to better health conditions.
                            <br /><br />
                            The students of Asoka vidyalaya contributed towards a very important endevour by making selfless efforts to improve the physical conditions which were available in the orthopaedic unit of the Colombo General Hospital.
                            <br /><br />
                            The physical conditions of majority of the government institutions which were committed for serving the public is not very attractive owing to the increase of population and owing to being neglected for a long time. But the government institutons and the services provided by the government can be recognized as the only solace for the general public of this country.
                            <br /><br />
                            The orthopaedic unit of the Colombo National Hospital was not in possession of an attractive environment earlier. The students of Asoka Vidyalaya understood the need to improve the available conditions and hence engaged in this meritorious deed with the cooperation of the principal of the school, teachers, parents, external community and other interested parties.
                            <br /><br />
                            The students were able to reconstruct the  OPD of the orthopaedic clinic of the hospital which receives a large number of patients coming from all the corners of the country daily.This project is not limited to one or two days and will be contituously  implemented each year.
                            <br /><br />
                            The new environment is attractive and promotes better health conditions.
                            <br /><br />
                            Further the kolakenda –herbal drink project which was started to raise funds contributes towards a better level of nutrition among the students.
                            <br /><br />
                            Thus the students of Asoka Vidyalaya have been exemplary in dealing with the Mother Sri lanka ‘Apen ratata Rata negumata ‘national programme.They are honoured with the silver award  for being capable of identifying a very important mission that should be fulfilled by the children of mother Sri Lanka.
